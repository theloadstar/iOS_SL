# The Basics

### Naming Constants and Variables

Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:

```swift
1. let π = 3.14159
2. let 你好 = "你好世界"
3. let 🐶🐮 = "dogcow"
```

> **Note**:
>
> If you need to give a constant or variable the same name as a reserved Swift keyword, surround the keyword with backticks (```) when using it as a name. However, avoid using keywords as names unless you have absolutely no choice.

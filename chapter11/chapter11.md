Select, delete, insert and update are the basic operations when dealing with data. We've realized how to select, let's achieve deleting.

# MVC

* Model:

  responsible for holding the data or any operations on the data. The simplest model is *Array*.

* View:

  manages the visual display of information.

* Controller;

  a bridge between the model and the view. It translates the user interaction from the view (e.g. tap) into the appropriate action to be performed in the model.

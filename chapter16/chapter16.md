# Customize DetailView

Let's change the number of DetailView cells from 2 to 4 first, remove the labels of two new cells.

## Third cell

Add a new label, set the font to `HeadLine` and modify its title to `SubsectionTitle`. Do you notice the gray separator blow the Label? Actually it's a UIViewðŸ¤£, whose height is 1.Set its background color to `light gray`, lock its height. Embed label and separator, set constraints 5,18,12,18. To support the Dynamic Type, change the top constraint to `>=`.

## Fourth cell

This cell should be bigger, so change the height of this cell to 215.BTW, we can change the height of interface view like this:

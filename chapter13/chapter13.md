This chapter mainly talks about the concept of **Object Oriented Programming**, aka **OOP** in short.

# Why OOP?

> First, why OOP? One important reason is that we want to decompose complex software into smaller pieces (or building block) which are easier to develop and manage. Here, the smaller pieces are the objects. Each object has its own responsibility, and objects coordinate with each other in order to make the software work. That is the basic concept of OOP.

# properties and functionalities

Like a car, its color, model, top speed are properties, while accelerate, brake, steering are functionalities. We can treat **method** and **functionalities** the same one.

# Class, Objects and instance

Class is easy to understand, and **Objects** represent all the **instance** of one Class. For the sake of simplicity, **Object** and **instance** are sometimes interchangeable.

> A blueprint for a house design is like a class description. All the houses built from that blueprint are objects of that class. A given house is an instance.

# Create a brand new Class
